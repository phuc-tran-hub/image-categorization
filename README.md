# image-categorization

Project Description: I worked on a project focused on image categorization, where I implemented PyTorch functions to create and train a model that predicted scene categories from a predefined set of classes. This involved preprocessing and organizing a dataset containing 32,000 RGB images (32 × 32) belonging to 16 categories, along with a validation set and a test set. I created TensorDatasets, defined a convolutional neural network architecture, and implemented preprocessing steps like zero-centering and optional contrast normalization and whitening. The project specified a base model architecture, detailing layer types, kernel sizes, strides, and other parameters that I implemented using PyTorch’s Sequential API. Additionally, I defined a training policy dictionary that outlined parameters such as learning rate, momentum, and batch size.
